# Oscilloscope Simulator

Oscilloscope Simulator and Signal Generator.

Oscilloscope Simulator is an Oscilloscope Simulator software with an integrated Wave Generator.
This Simulator has the ability to capture data from a bench Oscilloscope (GW Instek GDS-2062) to your PC, via usb connection, and show the waveforms on Oscilloscope Simulator software. This Simulator also allows you to analyze waveforms that were generated by the integrated wave generator and from storage files on your computer in the following formats:

• .xlsx, xls, xlsm 
• .txt
• .csv

You can save all your waveforms, displayed on the simulator screen, on your computer in JPEG and PNG formats. You can also save data in .csv and .txt files.

I developed this project to help Electrical Engineering students to get familiar with a digital oscilloscope, using an user interface identical to a real bench digital oscilloscope, making it more appealing. This oscilloscope simulator is the perfect tool for all the students that need to get used to an oscilloscope and use it anywhere.

Manual folder contains an user guide, in portuguese and english, to help you install and explore this simulator.
